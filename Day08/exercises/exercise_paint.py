# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall.
#   Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

#Write your code below this line 👇
import math

def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
    result = int(math.ceil(((height*width)/cover)))
    print(f"You'll need {result} cans of paint.")

#Write your code above this line 👆
# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)
